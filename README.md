# Hospital Management System

## Overview
The Hospital Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the management of patient information and prescriptions in a healthcare setting. This system is built using Python and the Tkinter library for creating a user-friendly graphical interface, and it uses a MySQL database to store and manage patient data.

## Features
- **Patient Information Management**: Capture and maintain detailed patient records, including personal information, medical conditions, and prescribed medications.
- **Prescription Generation**: Generate prescriptions with patient and medication details for healthcare professionals' convenience.
- **Record Updates**: Update patient records as needed, ensuring that the information is always up to date.
- **Record Deletion**: Remove patient records securely when necessary.
- **Data Display**: View and manage patient records in a tabular format to facilitate easy access and manipulation.
- **Data Validation**: Validate data entry to maintain data integrity and minimize errors.
- **Message Box Handling**: Implement message boxes for user notifications, error handling, and confirmations.

## Technologies Used
The project leverages the following skills and technologies:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the system.
- **Tkinter**: A Python library used for creating the graphical user interface, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
- **MySQL**: A robust relational database management system utilized for storing and managing patient data securely.
- **Database Operations**: Skills related to connecting to and performing various operations on the MySQL database, including inserting, updating, and deleting records.
- **GUI Development**: Creating an intuitive graphical user interface to enhance user interaction.
- **Data Entry and Validation**: Capturing and validating data from users to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
- **Data Retrieval and Display**: Fetching and displaying patient records from the database to provide quick access.
- **Message Box Handling**: Implementing message boxes for user communication and error handling.

## Motivation
